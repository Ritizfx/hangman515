# Pyhon Hangman Game

## Description
The Python Hangman Game is a command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game. The computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the word letter by letter within a limited number of incorrect guesses. This project is part of my learning process in Python, focusing on control flow, functions, and handling user input.

### Aim of the Project
* Pratice Python fundamentals like loops, functions, and conditionals.
* Devlop a fun and interactive game that improves error handling and User experience.
* Practice object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes and methods.
* Improve code readability and maintainability through modular design and refactoring.

### Lesson Learnt:
* Input validation using Python's built-in methods like isalpha()
* To break problems into smaller and manageable functions.
* Using Git and GitHub to manage and track code versions.
* OOP practices: Encapsulating functionality into methods within a class for better structure and readability.
* Refactoring: Continuously improving the structure of the codebase, avoiding code duplication, and simplifying logic.

### Project Features

* Input validation: The game will only accept single alphabetical character inputs.
* Tracking guesses: Keeps track of the user's guesses and prevents repeated guesses.
* Lives: The player has a limited number of lives, decreasing with incorrect guesses.
* Word progression: Displays the word with underscores representing unguessed letters, updating the display as correct letters are guessed.
