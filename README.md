# Pyhon Hangman Game

## Description
The Python Hangman Game is a command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game. The computer randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the word letter by letter within a limited number of incorrect guesses. This project is part of my learning process in Python, focusing on control flow, functions, and handling user input.

### Aim of the Project
* Pratice Python fundamentals like loops, functions, and conditionals.
* Devlop a fun and interactive game that improves error handling and User experience.

### Lesson Learnt:
* Input validation using Python's built-in methods like isalpha()
* To break problems into smaller and manageable functions.
* Using Git and GitHub to manage and track code versions.
